It might contain errors, bugs, etc. Many other non-core elements of the project are considered secondary.</sub>

#### Features:

- **Exclusion Feature:**
  - Specify directories to exclude from updating, allowing for fine-grained control over the synchronization process.

- **Cron Integration:**
  - Seamlessly integrate GitSyncMaster with cron jobs for scheduled updates at predefined intervals, ensuring your repositories are always up to date.

#### Installation (Special version for Arch Linux)*
#### Via AUR using YAY

[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/gitsync)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gitsync)

GitSyncMaster (gitsync on AUR) is available on AUR (Arch User Repository), and it can be installed using the `yay` package manager. Follow the steps below to install:

1. Make sure you have `yay` installed. If not, you can install it with the following command:
   
   ```
   sudo pacman -S yay
   ```
   Once yay is installed, you can install Term PDF by running the following command:
   
   ```
   yay -S gitsync
   ```
This command will automatically fetch the package from AUR and handle the installation process for you.

Then, run it with the following command:

```
gitsync
```

<sub>*IMPORTANT NOTE USAGE: Once it's installed, and you run the software, you should be able to update your repositories, but, you **should** be withtin a directory with all the repositories you want to update. Right now it's going to be tested using Python and/or Bash.</sub>

#### Usage Instructions:

1. **Bash Script (git_update.sh):**
   - Ensure the script has execute permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x git_update.sh
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     ./git_update.sh
     ```

2. **Python Script (git_update.py):**
   - Install Python if not already installed.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python git_update.py
     ```

3. **Cron Integration:**
   - Open the crontab editor:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add the following line to run the script every hour:
     ```bash
     0 * * * * /path/to/git_update.sh
     ```
     Ensure to replace `/path/to/git_update.sh` with the actual path to the Bash script.


#### Usage Instructions (with Exclusions):

1. **Bash Script (git_update_exclude.sh):**
   - Ensure the script has execute permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x git_update_exclude.sh
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     ./git_update_exclude.sh
     ```

2. **Python Script (git_update_exclude.py):**
   - Install Python if not already installed.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python git_update_exclude.py
     ```

3. **Cron Integration:**
   - Open the crontab editor:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add the following line to run the script every hour:
     ```bash
     0 * * * * /path/to/git_update.sh
     ```
     Ensure to replace `/path/to/git_update.sh` with the actual path to the Bash script.

4. **Excluding Directories:**
   - To exclude directories from updating, edit the `exclude_directories` list in the script:
     ```bash
     exclude_directories=(
         "/path/dir1"
         "/path/dir2"
         # Add or remove more directories as needed
     )
     ```
   - Set `exclude_flag` to `true` to enable exclusion feature:
     ```bash
     exclude_flag=true
     ```
   - Run the script to perform updates with exclusions taken into account.

#

**Note: On macOS usually the directory can be like this:**

```
 main_directory="/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/user/Documents/Development"
```

Or possibly, you can use a relative path instead of an absolute one:

```
 main_directory="/Users/user/Documents/Development/excludedir1"
```
The code for macOS is in the following directory within the repository:

```
src/macos
```
